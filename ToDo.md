22.10.2024 — Meeting with Ted

(see Hacked MD for detailed notes)

Take-Away: Make tons of different little experiments. A shit ton of baby experiments to understand the concepts. As many mini examples you can the better.

29.10.2024 — Set up collaborating on GitHub

Set up the Workflow (what to call it) & filling structure
1.1 Download GitHub Desktop
1.2 Watch tutorial on GitHub Desktop Collaboration
Make a laundry list of the bits and pieces we think we should learn: then categorize them, where do they fall under (CSS, JS, typography) so we can work in them, folder structure or naming structure.
