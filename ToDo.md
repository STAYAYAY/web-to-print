[Hacked MD file](https://hackmd.io/SSLkuaU9RfeTpcE6LhCBSw)

Take-Away: Make tons of different little experiments. A shit ton of baby experiments to understand the concepts. As many mini examples you can the better.

**29.10.2024 — Set up collaborating on GitHub**

[X] Set up the Workflow (what to call it) & filing structure  
[X] 1.1 Download GitHub Desktop  
[X] 1.2 Watch tutorial on GitHub Desktop Collaboration  
[X] Make a laundry list of the bits and pieces we think we should learn: then categorize them, where do they fall under (CSS, JS, typography) so we can work in them, folder structure or naming structure.

Experimenting

**19.11.2024**  
[ ] Do index.html instead of the MD for all our sketches.  
[ ] style the index.html with CSS, with different columns, classes, favourites etc. so it's easier to navigate  
[ ] reverse chronological order  
[ ] use title tags for comments to each other?  
[ ] And README can just be a quick sentence or whatever (would only be seen if people go on the GitHub)  
[ ] JavaScript classList to switch between classes defined in CSS  
[ ] JavaScript cssText to write CSS within JavaScript, would be useful for CSS grid nested elements  
[ ] back ticks in JavaScript  
[ ] body text across different divs, how to deal with overflow and tell it where to go, how to do that?  
[ ] what do we imagine people putting in? text, images, etc. do we need some sort of database?  
[ ] work with all lowercase for all the folders?  
[ ] JSON !!! JSON.stringify JSON.parse
