          AN IRONIC DREAM OF A COMMON LANGUAGE FOR WOMEN IN THE INTEGRATED
          CIRCUIT
        </h2>
        <p>
          This chapter is an effort to build an ironic political myth faithful
          to feminism, socialism, and materialism. Perhaps more faithful as
          blasphemy is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification.
          Blasphemy has always seemed to require taking things very seriously. I
          know no better stance to adopt from within the secular-religious,
          evangelical traditions of United States politics, including the
          politics of socialist feminism. Blasphemy protects one from the moral
          majority within, while still insisting on the need for community.
          Blasphemy is not apostasy. Irony is about contradictions that do not
          resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension of
          holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary
          and true. Irony is about humour and serious play. It is also a
          rhetorical strategy and a political method, one I would like to see
          more honoured within socialist-feminism. At the centre of my ironic
          faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a
          creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social
          reality is lived social relations, our most important political
          construction, a world-changing fiction. The international women's
          movements have constructed 'women's experience', as well as uncovered
          or discovered this crucial collective object. This experience is a
          fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. Liberation rests
          on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative
          apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. The cyborg is a
          matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as
          women's experience in the late twentieth century. This is a struggle
          over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and
          social reality is an optical illusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs - creatures
          simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously
          natural and crafted.Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of
          couplings between organism and machine, each conceived as coded
          devices, in an intimacy and with a power that was not generated in the
          history of sexuality. Cyborg 'sex' restores some of the lovely
          replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic
          prophylactics against heterosexism). Cyborg replication is uncoupled
          from organic reproduction. Modern production seems like a dream of
          cyborg colonization work, a dream that makes the nightmare of
          Taylorism seem idyllic. And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C3I,
          command-control-communication-intelligence, an $84 billion item in
          1984'sUS defence budget. I am making an argument for the cyborg as a
          fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative
          resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings. Michael Foucault's
          biopolitics is a flaccid premonition of cyborg politics, a very open
          field.
