This repository documents the process of our individual project during the autumn semester 24/25 in the MA program Digital Communication Environments at IDCE HGK/FHNW. Throughout this project we aimed to explore innovative layout techniques and graphical frameworks that function seamlessly across both web and print mediums. The project was mentored by Ted Davis.
